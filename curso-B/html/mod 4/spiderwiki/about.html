                Hello, my name is vitor, I'm 20 years old and I'm working alone on this project <br>
                for our dear friend from the neighborhood. Well...I'm making this site to put <br>
                in my portfolio. The reasons I chose this theme are:
                 <ul>
                    <li>
                        First is why I obviously love the MCU along with all this <br>
                        universe and with ctzs spider-man is the character that most <br>
                        scored. I dedicate this work mainly to your great and late <br>
                        creator, Stan Lee, may he rest in peace after all his amazing <br>
                        work that still continues to be amazing.
                    </li> <br>
                    <li>
                        The second reason is why when I went to watch the new <br>
                        Spider-Verse (Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse), <br>
                        appeared many new characters that don't have a background <br>
                        explained in the film itself, however, I was super curious <br>
                        with what would be its origins within their own stories, <br> 
                        so I'm doing this site to inform all fans who is appearing <br>
                        in their screens and how this character got there, in short.<br>
                        But with attachments if you want to go deeper.<br>
